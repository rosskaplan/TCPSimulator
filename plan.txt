1024 byte packet (might not use full packet)




Consider using byte stuffing (since we just need 2 bytes and a 2 couple of bits)


Consider using a VLC for compression

Header contents:
* MD5 checksum
* Sequence # (as below)
	-For 1000MB file size, 2 million packets, assuming 500 bytes per packet.
	-3 bytes for packet number
* 



Strategy:

Sender
*Send 5 packets in one go
*Have timeout for ack
*Switch (ack received) - cancel timeout
	- All good
		-- Send next 5
	- None good
		-- Resend all 5
	- Some good
		-- Resend bad, and send next to fill to 5 packets
*Ack not received by timeout, resend all 5 packets
		
		
Receiver
*receive at least one packet
*have a timeout to receive the rest
*If all 5 packets are recieved and are correct, cancel timeout, send ack in one packet for all 5
*If at least one packet is not received by timeout, send ack for correct packets
*If all packets are received but at least one is incorrect, cancel timeout, send ack for correct packets
